  This dataset is called TOXIGEN from Microsoft, which contain hate speeches.

  I already download three files of this dataset from huggingface.
  The first file is called 'toxigen_annotated'.
  The second file is called 'toxigen_annotations'.
  The third file is called 'toxigen_prompts'.
  And the datasets.ipynb is the python code to load, describe, and save the dataset.

  The websites below are the GitHub website and the HuggingFace website for this dataset.
